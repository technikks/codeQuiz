## Purpose
It's likely for any full-stack web developer to be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. This is an app with multiple-choice questions on JavaScript fundamentals. The coding quiz is timed and the score will be shown at the end. The app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It will have clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
